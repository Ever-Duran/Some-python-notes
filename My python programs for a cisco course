#There once was a hat. The hat contained no rabbit, but a list of five numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

#Your task is to:
    #write a line of code that prompts the user to replace the middle number in the list with an integer number entered by the user (Step 1)
    #write a line of code that removes the last element from the list (Step 2)
    #write a line of code that prints the length of the existing list (Step 3).

#my_code
hat_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
hat_list[2] = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(hat_list)

del hat_list[-1]
print(hat_list)

#CISCO exercise about lists

#Write a program that reflects these changes and lets you practice with the concept of lists. Your task is to:

    #step 1: create an empty list named beatles;
    #step 2: use the append() method to add the following members of the band to the list: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison;
    #step 3: use the for loop and the append() method to prompt the user to add the following members of the band to the list: Stu Sutcliffe, and Pete Best;
    #step 4: use the del instruction to remove Stu Sutcliffe and Pete Best from the list;
    #step 5: use the insert() method to add Ringo Starr to the beginning of the list.


#Step1
beatles = []

#Step2
beatles.append("John Lennon")
beatles.append("Paul McCartney")
beatles.append("George Harrison")
print(beatles)
 
#Step3
member1 = "Stu Sutcliffe"
member2 = "Pete Best"

for i in beatles:
    beatles.append(member1)
    beatles.append(member2)
    
    print(beatles)
    break

#Step4
del beatles[4]
print(beatles)

del beatles[3]
print(beatles)

#Step5
beatles.insert(0, "Ringo Starr")
print(beatles)
print("The Fab", len(beatles))
